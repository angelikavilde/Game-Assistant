# Game Assistant

## Overview

This project is a discord bot that can be added to any discord server with an invite link provided with permissions. The bot is able to interact with messages and has commands that it could perform when activated. The bot is created with Discord Developer Portal that provides the bot's token and adds the permissions required for the bot. The main functionalities of the bot is to facilitate various gaming experiences within the Discord server. Whether it's orchestrating games like Among Us by granting and revoking channel speaking permissions, assisting in team management for Codenames, or enhancing the Dungeons and Dragons (Dnd) experience by managing player inventories with a PostgreSQL (PSQL) database hosted on the cloud and maintaining a storyline log for user reference during future sessions.

The bot is hosted on cloud to be constantly online for users to use, just like its database for DnD items (**Reference [hosting](#hosting)**). With the use of the bot - many possible errors were managed and handled to ensure the bot's other functionalities would not be affected. One of the huge additions was the class to manage various servers as if an event was activated on one server - it is desired to not activate the event globally but only on that one server. Similar thing was implemented for logging in the story for the DnD event as it'd be more preferable to only show the logged story for the server that has interacted with the command to log in the story previously.

The script includes a file named `easter_egg.py` which is not uploaded on github but it includes extra secret interactions that the bot will do upon reading specific words in the user's message. Those interactions include direct replies to messages, reactions to messages and personalised replies.

The script for the bot uses various UI components from the discord.py from select manus to buttons. In future, the project could be expanded to keep more user's data in the database and to include more available UI components available with Python as currently, the bot's functionalities are quite limited.

## Hosting

## Set-up

Clone the repository and follow the next steps to set up the bot yourself:

### Setting up locally

1. Set-up virtual environment
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `psql postgres` - Make sure PSQL is installed
4. (in PSQL) `CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;`
5. `psql -U <user_name> -d <db_name> < dnd_db.sql`

**For local use - change line 228 in dnd_event.py to: return connect(host=localhost, dbname=<db_name>, cursor_factory=RealDictCursor)**

6. Run the bot: `python3 main.py`

**Steps 1,2 and 6 could be changed to running a Dockerfile (as below)**

### Setting up locally with Dockerfile

1. `docker build . -t <image_name>` - Make sure Docker is installed
2. Steps 3-5 & **line change** from the set-up above
3. `docker run -d <image_name>`

### Setting up on cloud

To set up the project on cloud, the only 2 required steps are to create PSQL database and add its info to .env file with any neccessary changes in the line 228 in `dnd_event.py`. This project is currently using [üêò ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) to host the PSQL database, for connection of which - only the database IP is required. The next required step to host the bot on cloud is the Dockerfile hosting. For which, this project is using [ü™Å FlyIO](https://fly.io/) (the toml file for which is labelled as `fly.toml`). To run it with fly, next commands need to be ran after installing Fly:

1. `fly launch`
2. `fly deploy`
3. `fly scale count 1`

**When using fly to host the bot, it is important that the following is added to the fly.toml file:**
`auto_stop_machines = false` - as it would stop the bot from running constantly
